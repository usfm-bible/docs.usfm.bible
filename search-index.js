All USFM markers begin with a backslash character \\. Paragraph markers end with the next space character. Character markers occur in pairs, marking a span of text within a paragraph. Note markers also occur in pairs, marking the start and end of the footnote, cross reference, or study note content. For marker pairs (character and note), the opening marker ends with the next space character (as with paragraph markers). The matching closing marker is identical to the opening marker but ends with an asterisk character *. Example: \\w grace\\w*. Some USFM markers include an optional numeric variable, which is represented in this documentation by a hash character . In USFM the number indicates: * A portion of a complete element, or relative weighting of the \"pieces\" of the elements, such as \\mt1, \\mt2, \\mt3 which are parts of a major title. * The level of the division or section (hierarchy). * The level of indentation relative to other like elements, as in poetry (\\q) or lists (\\li#) or outlines (\\io#). marker = marker1 — The unnumbered version of a marker should only be used when only one level of this marker exists within the text. Numbered markers should always be used when more than one level of the marker exists within the text. A specific numbered marker should not be used to indicate a specific occurrence of the element type (e.g. you should not use \\s3 to represent the the particular section heading occuring before the \"Story of Creation\" in Genesis 1.) The boundaries of footnote or cross reference text are defined by an opening and closing marker, as in the following footnote syntax example: \\f_+_(\\fr_REF_)footnote content\\f* Elements which make up the footnote or cross reference content are character level markers, which means that they each define a start and a end marker. Some USFM editors interpret the presence of a new character marker as an implicit closure of any preceding character level marker. As a result, most scripture translation projects working with USFM have adopted the approach of authoring footnotes or cross references without supplying the explicit end marker, since this reduces the amount of markup within the notes, and is somewhat easier to read and interpret. Examples of the two markup approaches for notes is provided below: Example 1. Implicit closure `+\\f + \\fk Issac: \\ft In Hebrew means \"laughter\"\\f*+` Example 2. Explicit end marker `+\\f + \\fk Issac:\\fk* \\ft In Hebrew means \"laughter\"\\ft*\\f*+` Example 3. Immplicit closure \\f + \\fr 1.14 \\fq religious festivals; \\ft or \\fqa seasons.\\f* Example 4.

Significant whitespace is a critical part of the USFM document and should always be preserved as is.

Insignificant whitespace should be normalized by a USFM processor. Multiple whitespace within the body text of a paragraph. Multiple whitespace preceding a paragraph marker. USFM processors should treat the single CR (U+000D) or LF (U+000A) characters, and the sequence Carriage Return-Line Feed (CRLF), like a single LF character. Applications can save documents using the appropriate line-ending convention. All paragraph markers should be preceded by a single newline. As a recommended best practice for USFM editors, inline markup (character-level markup, footnotes, or cross references) should not be preceded by a newline. It would be acceptable for a whitespace normalization process to replace a newline and any preceding space (multiple spaces) before this inline markup with a single space (#3), but it should not remove all whitespace. In the following example, the footnote \\f ...\\f* at Matthew 6:27: \\v 27 Can any of you live a bit longer \\f + \\fr 6.27: \\fq live a bit longer; \\ft or \\fq grow a bit taller.\\f* by worrying about it? would be normalized as: \\v 27 Can any of you live a bit longer \\f + \\fr 6.27: \\fq live a bit longer; \\ft or \\fq grow a bit taller.\\f* by worrying about it? Multiple whitespace between the end of a paragraph marker and the paragraph text are normalized to a single space (U+0020). Multiple whitespace between words are normalized to a single space (U+0020). Multiple whitespace between text and a character or note marker (f, ex, x, ex; not esb or esbe) are normalized to a single space (U+0020). Due to the extensive common practice in USFM documents of adding new verse text after a newline, multiple whitespace between text and a verse marker should be normalized as a single newline. Multiple whitespace preceding a paragraph marker is normalized to a single newline. Normalized whitespace preceding and following a character or note marker pair is preserved. (USFM validation tools may flag suspicious whitespace.) Normalized whitespace preceding the closing marker of a character or note marker pair is preserved. (USFM validation tools may flag suspicious whitespace.) Significant whitespace should not be added to the text. The normalization rules outlined in 3,5,7 can result in whitespace remaining in the text which may be considered insignificant depending on its context. For example, the space preceding the footnote in: \\v 27 Can any of you live a bit longer \\f + \\fr 6.27: \\fq live a bit longer; could be removed: \\v 27 Can any of you live a bit longer\\f + \\fr 6.27: \\fq live a bit longer; And a space after a cross reference occurring at the start of a verse: v 7 \\x - \\xo 2.7: \\xt 1 Co 15.45.\\x* Then the \\nd Lord\\nd* God took some soil from the ground and formed a man could be removed: v 7 \\x - \\xo 2.7: \\xt 1 Co 15.45.\\x*Then the \\nd Lord\\nd* God took some soil from the ground and formed a man Yet, a normalization process cannot generally remove ALL whitespace preceding and following note marker pairs. In many cases a single whitespace is expected between the texts which precede and follows a note. As suggested and recommended earlier: USFM validation tools may flag suspicious whitespace. USFM editors can takes steps to discourage ambiguous whitespace wherever possible. USFM normalization tools can identify and handles special contexts (examples above). USFM publication tools and other post processors can identify and handle special contexts in the manner which is most suitable for the intended output.","title":"Whitespace","component":"usfm-usx-docs","version":"latest","name":"whitespace","url":"/usfm-usx-docs/latest/whitespace.html","titles":[{"text":"Newlines","hash":"newlines","id":1},{"text":"Whitespace Normalization","hash":"normalization","id":2},{"text":"Handling special contexts","hash":"_handling_special_contexts","id":3}]},"8":{"id":8,"text":"USFM 3 provides a general syntax for adding named attributes to character markers. Attributes define additional properties for the marked content, and are a means of extending the meta-information contained within in a USFM text. USFM formally defines attributes for a selected set of current character markers. In USFM, within a character marker span an attributes list is separated from the text content by a vertical bar |. Attributes are listed as pairs of name and corresponding value using the syntax: attribute=\"value\". The attribute name is a single ASCII string. The value is wrapped in quotes. Example 1. USFM: Glossary word with lemma attribute \\w gracious|lemma=\"grace\"\\w* In USX, attributes are applied to elements in the standard XML syntax: attribute=\"value\". Example 2. USX: Glossary word with lemma attribute Nearly all USX elements contain a required style attribute. For and elements, the style attribute defines the paragraph or character type. In USFM, when content is supplied in the position of a marker attribute, but without an explicit attribute name, the USFM specification defines a single default. Example 3. Glossary word with un-named default lemma attribute \\w gracious|grace\\w* This allows a commonly used attribute (the default) to be expressed with as little additional markup as possible within the text. The concept of a \"default attribute\" is only valid in USFM. In USX, XML attributes are always expressed as attribute=\"value\" together. Example 4. USX: Glossary word with lemma attribute In cases where more than one value is needed for an attribute key, the author should provide a comma separated list within the value string. Leading and trailing whitespace adjacent to the comma separators are ignored. Example 5. Glossary word with multiple strong values \\w gracious|strong=\"H1234,G5485\"\\w* See the attributes for wordlist/glossary entry for additional examples. In cases where an attribute value is composed of multiple parts (e.g. a compound word or phrase), the author can separate the parts using a colon : within the value string. See the gloss attribute for ruby glosses for an example of the use of this syntax. Pre-existing markers which formally provide attributes in USFM 3 (or newer) may continue to be used without attributes. \\w gracious\\w*(no attributes) remains valid USFM content. Using the general syntax, attributes may be added to any character markers beyond the formalized set for the current version of USFM. These will not be considered strictly USFM compliant, and there is no assurance that they will be supported by compliant software tools or processes. Future versions of USFM may formally provide additional attributes. Any user defined attributes must begin with the prefix x-. Example 6. USFM: Glossary word with user defined attribute \\w gracious|x-myattr=\"metadata\"\\w* \\w gracious|lemma=\"grace\" x-myattr=\"metadata\"\\w* Example 7.

In some texts, the USFM markup required to identify the content will require nesting one character level marker within another character level marker. In these situations a USFM editor, processor, or publishing system must understand how to interpret or display the nested markup contexts. In some editors (e.g. Paratext), the start of a new character level marker is interpreted as an implicit closure of the the previous character environment. If the intent is to nest the inner character markup, the meaning or formatting applied to the outer marker layer applies to the inner level also. The inner markup adds additional meaning and formatting for the nested text. The most common occurrence for nested character markup is within footnotes, where text occurring within a footnote quotation (\\fq), keyword (\\fk), or the footnote text (\\ft), requires further markup. In USX, nested elements occur in XML normally without requiring any additional syntax. In USFM, add a plus sign + as a prefix to the opening and closing forms of a nested marker pair to indicate that a nested character environment is starting. The + is added after the backslash, and before the marker text. In the following example text: * \\+nd indicates to start a new character environment nested inside the existing \\add environment (without closing \\add) * \\+nd* indicates to end the nested environment without closing \\add The following is a \\add translator's addition containing the word \\+nd Lord\\+nd* within it\\add* All new character marker starts (without the + prefix) close all existing nesting.

Syntax USFM: \\[ms@style]\\* USX: ms@style Milestone type qt# - Quotations ts - Translator’s section USFM USX Markup for identifying milestones is needed when documents have multiple structures that interact in a non-hierarchical manner. This is also referred to as 'overlapping' or 'concurrent' markup. A key example of the overlapping structures in scripture text are Paragraphs used to structure the discourse/narrative of the text and The division of the text into books, chapters and verses. In USFM or USX texts, markup identifying paragraph level containers forms the main structure of the document, while chapter and verse markers are effectively milestones. Another overlapping structure is encountered when identifying the start and end of the words of individual speakers within the text, which will regularly cross paragraph boundaries. In USFM, milestones follow a syntax similar to character level markup, but using a unique self-closing syntax. This specific syntax identifies the marker as a milestone. Milestones can mark a single position within the text, or the positions of the start or end of a span of text. Self-closing markup is indicated by immediately terminating the marker, and any attributes, with a second backslash plus asterisk \\*. In USX, a milestone is expressed using the element. A milestone marker may end with either -s or -e -s indicates that the milestone is for marking the start of a span of text. -e indicates that the marker is an end milestone. USFM USX Example 1. USFM: Milestones for the start and end of a quotation/speaker \\qt1-s\\* ... \\qt1-e\\* Example 2. USX: Milestone for the start of a quotation/speaker ...

USX: Standalone milestone USFM or USX do not currently define any standalone milestones. This may change with future updates, as specific needs are identified. The following optional attributes can be added to any USFM milestone marker. sid A unique identifier which can be used to unambiguously identify the starting milestone, and to clearly associate the starting milestone with the ending milestone (eid). The sid can be composed of any mixture of numbers, letters, and underscores, and should be a unique sid throughout the scripture text. eid A unique identifier which can be used to unambiguously identify the ending milestone, and to clearly associate the ending milestone with the starting milestone (sid). If an sid attribute is used for the starting milestone in a milestone pair, the ending milestone must include eid. Additional attributes may be available for or required by a specific milestone type (e.g the use of the who attribute in the following quotation milestone example). USFM USX Example 5.

The Law of Moses allowed people to eat any fish with fins and scales, but since catfish lack scales (as do eels and sharks) they were not to be eaten (\\xt Lev 11.9-12\\xt*).

For new readers or readers new to the Biblical texts it may be very difficult for them to recognize what Chinese or Japanese word corresponds to the Han character(s) they are seeing. Ruby glosses: In order to help these readers, some Bibles are printed with glosses using small phonetic characters (e.g. Japanese uses the hiragana alphabet) placed above the more symbolic Han characters to tell the reader how to pronounce the character. These phonetic characters are generically called “ruby glosses” or “rubies”. In Japanese this technique is called Furigana. Description Ruby gloss.

Introduction to Mark (Good News Study Bible) \\ip However, he is more than a teacher, healer, or \\w miracle\\w*-worker. He is also the Messiah, the Son of God, the Son of Man. These three titles express the first Christians' understanding of who Jesus is. \\ili 1 \\k The Messiah\\k* is the one promised by God, the one who would come and free God's people. By the time \\bk The Gospel of Mark\\bk* appeared, the title \"Messiah\" (in Greek, \"\\w christ\\w*\") had become a proper name, so that the Gospel opens with \"the Good News about Jesus Christ\" (and not \"Jesus the Christ\"). Peter's confession (8.29) marks a turning-point in the ministry of Jesus. The title \"\\w son of david\\w* \" (10.46-48) also identifies Jesus as the Messiah, who would restore to Israel the power and glory it enjoyed under David's reign (also 12.35-37). \\ili 2 \\k The Son of God\\k* is the title by which the heavenly voice addresses Jesus at his baptism (1.11) and his transfiguration (9.7). And at Jesus' death the Roman officer confesses that Jesus is the Son of God (15.39). \\ili 3 \\k The Son of Man\\k* is the title most often used of Jesus, and it appears only on the lips of Jesus. This enigmatic title appears in \\bk The Book of Daniel\\bk* (Dan 7.13n), where it is applied to the exalted figure to whom God gives universal dominion. In \\bk Mark\\bk* the title is used of Jesus in three ways: the Son of Man acts with divine power (2.10, 28); he will be rejected, will suffer and die (8.31; 9.9, 12, 31; 10.33-34, 45; 14.21, 41); he will return in power and glory (8.38; 13.26; 14.62).","title":"ili#","component":"usfm-usx-docs","version":"latest","name":"ili","url":"/usfm-usx-docs/latest/para/introductions/ili.html","titles":[{"text":"Summary","hash":"_summary","id":1},{"text":"Properties","hash":"_properties","id":2},{"text":"Structure","hash":"_structure","id":3},{"text":"Examples","hash":"_examples","id":4},{"text":"Publication Issues","hash":"_publication_issues","id":5}]},"89":{"id":89,"text":"Description Introduction continuation (margin) paragraph.
