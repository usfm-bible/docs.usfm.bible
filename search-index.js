The common abbreviation for these expressions are USFM, USX, and USJ. This documentation provides a summary of markup syntax, schema diagrams, and example texts for both USFM and USX. USJ is a newer expression. Equivalent example texts in USJ are also being added. Previous release notes (3.0 and earlier) are expressed only in USFM-FM specific terms. The key differences in the grammar from USFM 3.0 to 3.1.0 are: BookTitles are optional. BookHeaders include sts. BookIdentification may be any 3 letter code (within reason). Other peripherals may be of any type. Section, Verse, and other Para (paragraphs) are seperated as different categories (internal). The paragraph @vid attribute has an extended reference syntax. Character markers and nesting: All character elements must be closed explicitly, with the exception of note structural elements (below). Note specific character elements (i.e. f…​ fr, fq, ft, or x…​ xo, xt etc.) are considered note submarker elements. They provide structure to the note content. These note submarker elements continue to support (and recommend) the common pratice of implicit closure. Note content must occur within a submarker element; there can be no unmarked note content only within the note container itself. fv is now just a character style and requires explicit closing. Use of the + prefix for nested USFM character markup is supported but is deprecated. Note that future versions of USFM may remove support for the \\+ syntax entirely. Markings scripture references — ref and xt: Added ref for marking scripture references in all contexts (including xt), with an optional machine-readable target location. Deprecated use of the attribute @link-href with xt. Use ref. Deprecated use of xt outside of cross-reference. Use: ref. Deprecate the link- prefix in jmp attributes. Add @key attribute to the k character element. @sid and @eid attributes are not automatically available for all milestones, but may be used when specified directly (e.g. qt and ts) \\ escaping is required and supported for a number of key characters: \\, ', \", |, ~, / Whitespace rules are clarified and formalised.

A short description of the markup. A summary of the markup syntax is given in both USFM and USX syntax. The following conventions are used: markup : Monospaced text with a grey background is the explicit marker text required. placeholder : Red, italic text is a placeholder. The content which should be provided at the position of the placeholder is described below the syntax summary. @attribute : Required or optional attributes are listed as placeholders in red, italic text preceded by an @ symbol. placeholder or @attribute content which is required is identified by an * asterisk. If the documentation page is for a specific instance of a markup type, a link to the summary documentation for that marker type is given. For example: p is a type of Paragraph. The document division, paragraph, or note type where the selected markup is valid. The version of USFM/USX when this markup was added. The version of USFM/USX when this markup was updated, corrected, or possibly deprecated. Throughout this documentation, texts shown between square brackets, with a grey background, in [monospacedFont] are the names used for classes or terminals within the USFM/USX RNG schema. These names correspond to the terminal labels shown in syntax diagrams thoughout the documentation. 'Railroad' diagrams illustrate the syntax for components of the USFM/USX schema. Where a diagram is provided, USFM and USX expressions are given in separate tabs. Railroad diagrams for the paragraph element are shown below: USFM USX Diagrams are read from left to right.

In USFM, all markers begin with a backslash character \\. Paragraph markers, and the opening marker for characters and notes are followed by a space. Example: \\p . Character markers occur in pairs, marking a span of text within a paragraph. The closing marker is identical to the opening marker, terminated with an asterisk character *. Example: \\w grace\\w*. Note markers also occur in pairs, marking the start and end of the footnote or cross reference content. Milestone markers follow a syntax similar to character markers, but using a self-closing syntax which immediately terminates the marker with a second backslash plus asterisk \\*. Example: \\\\qt-s\\* Chapters and verses are unique elements. Their syntax is similar to a paragraph marker. The chapter or verse number itself is added after the marker and its space. Chapter and verses are also like milestones because they identify the location for the start of a chapter or verse. In USFM there is no marker to indicate the end of a chapter or verse. USX is an XML representation of the USFM data model. Paragraphs occur within a element. Character spans occur within a element. Notes occur within a element. Milestones occur as an element. Chapters and verses occur as 'milestone-like' self-closing or elements which identify the start for a chapter or verse. Optionally, and elements can be added to mark the end of a chapter or verse by using the eid attribute instead of the sid attribute. The end elements should be placed at the end of the Scripture text for chapter or verse. Different types of paragraph, character, note, or milestones are identified by a style attribute. The style attribute is the value which associates the element with its corresponding USFM marker. USJ is a JSON representation of the USFM data model. It is a first-class citizen among the other formats (USFM and USX) and has been added as a target in the test suite maintained by the committee. JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a modern data serialization format supported by many software tools and libraries. It is especially convenient to use in JavaScript-based technologies where it is natively supported. Chapters and verses are treated as milestones – denoting only their absolute position and not encapsulating text or other content within them. Chapter elements are valid at the outermost level – the same level as id and book headers. Verse elements, like character elements, are valid within paragraph-like parents at the same level as the textual content. The type key has values that refer to the node types in USX. e.g. para, char, book, chapter, verse, ms. The marker key has values that refer to marker names used in USFM and the style attribute in USX. Every attribute in a USX node becomes a key in the corresponding JSON object. { \"type\": \"book\", \"marker\": \"id\", \"code\": \"GEN\", \"content\": [] }, { \"type\": \"chapter\", \"marker\": \"c\", \"number\": \"1\", \"sid\": \"GEN 1\" } All objects may have nested content or textual content in an array for the contents key whose value is an array. { \"type\": \"para\", \"marker\": \"ide\", \"content\": [\"UTF-8\"] }, { \"type\": \"para\", \"marker\": \"usfm\", \"content\": [\"3.0\"] }, { \"type\": \"para\", \"marker\": \"is\", \"content\": [ \"Introduction\" ] }, { \"type\": \"para\", \"marker\": \"ip\", \"content\": [ { \"type\": \"char\", \"marker\": \"bk\", \"content\": [ \"The Gospel according to Mark\" ] }, \" begins with the statement...\" ] } Some markers or styles include an optional numeric variable, which is represented in this documentation by a hash character #. The number indicates: A portion of a larger text, or relative weighting of the components of the text, such as mt1, mt2, mt3 which are parts of a main title. The level of a division or section (hierarchy). The level of indentation relative to other like elements, as in poetry (q#) or lists (li#) or outlines (io#). marker = marker1 — The unnumbered version of a marker or style should only be used when one level of this marker exists within the text (only). Numbered markers should always be used when more than one level of the marker exists within the text. A specific numbered marker or style should not be used to indicate a specific occurrence of the element type (i.e. you should not use s3 to represent the the particular section heading occuring before the \"Story of Creation\" in Genesis 1.) Elements which make up footnote or cross reference content are character level markers. With USFM 3.1, ending character markers have been made required — except for the markers used to start sections in footnotes and cross references (the note’s 'structural elements'). The majority of scripture translation projects working with USFM already follow the implicit closure syntax for footnote or cross reference structural markup. Examples of the two markup approaches for notes are given below. Both of these are syntactically acceptable in USFM, but the implicit syntax is strongly recommended. Note content must always occur within a submarker; there can be no unmarked note content only within the note container itself. Other nested character markers within a notes structural sections always require explicit opening and closing markers.

Insignificant whitespace should be normalized by a USFM processor. Multiple whitespace within the body text of a paragraph. Multiple whitespace preceding a paragraph marker. USFM processors should treat the single CR (U+000D) or LF (U+000A) characters, and the sequence Carriage Return-Line Feed (CRLF), like a single LF character. Applications can save documents using the appropriate line-ending convention. All paragraph markers should be preceded by a single newline. As a recommended best practice for USFM editors, inline markup (character-level markup, footnotes, or cross references) should not be preceded by a newline. It would be acceptable for a whitespace normalization process to replace a newline and any preceding space (multiple spaces) before this inline markup with a single space (#3), but it should not remove all whitespace. In the following example, the footnote \\f ...\\f* at Matthew 6:27: \\v 27 Can any of you live a bit longer \\f + \\fr 6.27: \\fq live a bit longer; \\ft or \\fq grow a bit taller.\\f* by worrying about it? would be normalized as: \\v 27 Can any of you live a bit longer \\f + \\fr 6.27: \\fq live a bit longer; \\ft or \\fq grow a bit taller.\\f* by worrying about it? Multiple whitespace between the end of a paragraph marker and the paragraph text are normalized to a single space (U+0020). Multiple whitespace between words are normalized to a single space (U+0020). Multiple whitespace between text and a character or note marker (f, ex, x, ex; not esb or esbe) are normalized to a single space (U+0020). Due to the extensive common practice in USFM documents of adding new verse text after a newline, multiple whitespace between text and a verse marker should be normalized as a single newline. Multiple whitespace preceding a paragraph marker is normalized to a single newline. Normalized whitespace preceding and following a character or note marker pair is preserved. (USFM validation tools may flag suspicious whitespace.) Normalized whitespace preceding the closing marker of a character or note marker pair is preserved. (USFM validation tools may flag suspicious whitespace.) Significant whitespace should not be added to the text. The normalization rules outlined in 3,5,7 can result in whitespace remaining in the text which may be considered insignificant depending on its context. For example, the space preceding the footnote in: \\v 27 Can any of you live a bit longer \\f + \\fr 6.27: \\fq live a bit longer; could be removed: \\v 27 Can any of you live a bit longer\\f + \\fr 6.27: \\fq live a bit longer; And a space after a cross reference occurring at the start of a verse: v 7 \\x - \\xo 2.7: \\xt 1 Co 15.45.\\x* Then the \\nd Lord\\nd* God took some soil from the ground and formed a man could be removed: v 7 \\x - \\xo 2.7: \\xt 1 Co 15.45.\\x*Then the \\nd Lord\\nd* God took some soil from the ground and formed a man Yet, a normalization process cannot generally remove ALL whitespace preceding and following note marker pairs. In many cases a single whitespace is expected between the texts which precede and follows a note. As suggested and recommended earlier: USFM validation tools may flag suspicious whitespace. USFM editors can takes steps to discourage ambiguous whitespace wherever possible. USFM normalization tools can identify and handles special contexts (examples above). USFM publication tools and other post processors can identify and handle special contexts in the manner which is most suitable for the intended output.","title":"Whitespace","component":"usfm-usx-docs","version":"latest","name":"whitespace-old","url":"/usfm-usx-docs/latest/whitespace-old.html","titles":[{"text":"Newlines","hash":"newlines","id":1},{"text":"Whitespace Normalization","hash":"normalization","id":2},{"text":"Handling special contexts","hash":"_handling_special_contexts","id":3}]},"10":{"id":10,"text":"In USFM/USX, a 'common whitespace' (WS) character is defined by the pattern /(?:${ws}|${nl}|$)/, where: ws /[\\u0009\\u000D\\u000A\\u0020]/ A single whitespace character. nl /(?:\\u000D?\\u000A|\\u000D)/ A single newline (as supported by all operating systems). Common whitespace is found throughout the document content for most languages. Some common whitespace in USFM/USX documents is 'structural whitespace'. Structural (non-content) whitespace exists either to aid in the readability of a source file, or to delimit markers. Structural whitespace is identified in the documentation’s syntax diagrams (WS/Ws/HS/Hs) and is not part of the document content. All other characters are always treated as content (including other Unicode whitespace characters). Any common whitespace is reduced according to these rules: Any string of WS chars which includes a newline is reduced to a single newline. Any string of WS chars which does not include a newline is reduced to a single space. Common whitespace can be eliminated when it occurs: At the start of any element’s content. At the end of any element’s content, except inside a character element, when followed by text or another character element. Common whitespace canonicalization is done as follows: A newline before a character marker is converted to a space. That space is content. Any whitespace before a paragraph marker, including none, is replaced by a newline. This newline is not content. USX documents contain common whitespace that delimits aspects of the XML syntax itself. XML allows for unlimited whitespace wherever it is permitted by the XML syntax, which is typically added for the purpose of formatting for easier reading (i.e. 'pretty-printing').","title":"Whitespace","component":"usfm-usx-docs","version":"latest","name":"whitespace","url":"/usfm-usx-docs/latest/whitespace.html","titles":[{"text":"Definition","hash":"ws-definition","id":1},{"text":"Reducing or Eliminating Common Whitespace","hash":"ws-reducing","id":2}]},"11":{"id":11,"text":"USFM and USX 3 provide a syntax for adding named attributes to character markers. Attributes define additional properties for the marked content, and are a means of extending the meta-information contained within in a text. USFM formally defines attributes for a selected set of current character types. In USFM, within a character marker span an attributes list is separated from the text content by a vertical bar |. Attributes are listed as pairs of name + corresponding value using the syntax: attribute=\"value\". The attribute name is a single ASCII string. The value is wrapped in quotes. In USX, attributes are applied to elements in the standard XML syntax: attribute=\"value\". USFM USX USJ Example 1. Glossary word with lemma attribute \\w gracious|lemma=\"grace\"\\w* Example 2. Glossary word with lemma attribute gracious Example 3. Glossary word with lemma attribute { \"type\": \"char\", \"marker\": \"w\", \"lemma\": \"grace\", \"content\": [\"gracious\"] } Nearly all USX elements contain a required style attribute. For and elements, the style attribute defines the paragraph or character type. In USFM, when content is supplied in the position of an attribute, but without an explicit attribute name, the specification defines a single default. This allows a commonly used attribute (the default) to be added with as little additional markup in the text as possible. The concept of a \"default attribute\" is only valid in USFM. In USX, attributes always need to be expressed fully as attribute=\"value\" together. USFM USX USJ Example 4. Glossary word with un-named default lemma attribute \\w gracious|grace\\w* Example 5. USX: Glossary word with lemma attribute gracious Example 6. USX: Glossary word with lemma attribute { \"type\": \"char\", \"marker\": \"w\", \"lemma\": \"grace\", \"content\": [\"gracious\"] } In cases where more than one value is needed for an attribute key, use a comma separated list within the value string. Whitespace adjacent to the comma separators is ignored. USFM USX USJ Example 7. Glossary word with multiple strong values \\w gracious|strong=\"H1234,G5485\"\\w* Example 8. Glossary word with multiple strong values gracious Example 9. Glossary word with multiple strong values { \"type\": \"char\", \"marker\": \"w\", \"strong\": \"H1234,G5485\", \"content\": [\"gracious\"] } See the attributes for wordlist/glossary entry for other examples. In cases where an attribute value is composed of multiple parts (e.g. a compound word or phrase), separate the parts using a colon : within the value string. See the gloss attribute for ruby glosses for an example of the use of this syntax. Pre-existing markers which formally provide attributes in USFM/USX 3 (or newer) may continue to be used without attributes. \\w gracious\\w* (no attributes) and gracious remain valid. Using the general syntax above, attributes may be added to any character markers beyond the formalized set in the current version of the USFM/USX specification. These will not be considered canonical, and software supporting USFM/USX is not required to process user-defined attributes. User defined attributes must begin with the prefix x-.

Sometimes, marking texts in a semantically accurate way requires nesting a character level element within another character level element. In these situations an editor, processor, or publishing system must be able to interpret the nested markup contexts correctly. Initially, USFM did not allow character styles to be nested. Whenever a new character style was encountered in a paragraph the currently active character style was implicitly closed. However, it is a common occurrence for text within footnote sections, a footnote quotation (fq), keyword (fk), or the footnote text (ft) to contain some text that needs to be marked. With the character styles being implicitly closed, a new way of marking nesting was needed and the plus sign + was used as a prefix to the opening and closing forms of a nested marker pair. With USFM 3.1, the ending character marker has been made required — except for the markers used to start sections in footnotes and cross references (the note’s 'structural elements'). This allows nesting to be done without the use of the plus sign. For backward compatibility, the use of the plus sign will still be processed as it has been. In the following example text: \\nd indicates to start a new character element nested inside the existing \\add element (without closing \\add) \\nd* indicates the end of the nested environment without closing \\add USFM USX USJ \\p The following is a \\add translator's addition containing the word \\nd Lord\\nd* within it\\add* ...

In USX, nested elements occur in XML without requiring any additional syntax. USFM USX USJ Example 1.

Syntax USFM: \\style\\* USX: style * Milestone type qt# - Quotations ts - Translator’s section USFM USX Markup for identifying milestones is needed when documents have multiple structures that interact in a non-hierarchical manner. This is also referred to as 'overlapping' or 'concurrent' markup. A key example of the overlapping structures in scripture text are Paragraphs used to structure the discourse/narrative of the text and The division of the text into books, chapters and verses. In USFM or USX texts, markup identifying paragraph level containers forms the main structure of the document, while chapter and verse markers are effectively milestones. Another overlapping structure is encountered when identifying the start and end of the words of individual speakers within the text, which will regularly cross paragraph boundaries. In USFM, milestones follow a syntax similar to character level markup, but using a unique self-closing syntax. This specific syntax identifies the marker as a milestone. Milestones can mark a single position within the text, or the positions of the start or end of a span of text. Self-closing markup is indicated by immediately terminating the marker, and any attributes, with a second backslash plus asterisk \\*. In USX, a milestone is expressed using the element. A milestone marker may end with either -s or -e -s indicates that the milestone is for marking the start of a span of text. -e indicates that the marker is an end milestone. USFM USX Example 1. USFM: Milestones for the start and end of a quotation/speaker \\qt1-s\\* ... \\qt1-e\\* Example 2. USX: Milestone for the start of a quotation/speaker ... This syntax can also be used for standalone milestones, not using start -s and end -e suffixes. USFM USX Example 3. USFM: Standalone milestone (\\z namespace in this example) \\zms\\* Example 4. USX: Standalone milestone USFM or USX do not currently define any standalone milestones. This may change with future updates, as specific needs are identified. Attributes may be available for or required by a specific milestone type. For example: the @who attribute for the qt milestone. As with other USFM/USX numbered marker types, a numeric variable may be added to a milestone marker to indicate a relative weighting or level. In the example above of the quotation/speaker milestone, a numbered version of the marker may be used to indicate the level of nesting of the quotation being marked (i.e. a quote within a quote). The unnumbered version may be used when only one level of marker exists within the project text. Numbers should always be included when more than one level of the marker exists within the project text.","title":"Milestones","component":"usfm-usx-docs","version":"latest","name":"index","url":"/usfm-usx-docs/latest/ms/index.html","titles":[{"text":"Summary","hash":"_summary","id":1},{"text":"Diagrams","hash":"_diagrams","id":2},{"text":"Background","hash":"_background","id":3},{"text":"Basic Syntax","hash":"_basic_syntax","id":4},{"text":"Indicating Start and End Milestones","hash":"_indicating_start_and_end_milestones","id":5},{"text":"Standalone Milestones","hash":"_standalone_milestones","id":6},{"text":"Attributes","hash":"_attributes","id":7},{"text":"Levels","hash":"_levels","id":8}]},"28":{"id":28,"text":"Description Quotation start and end milestones.

The most common fish in the Lake of Galilee were carp and catfish. The Law of Moses allowed people to eat any fish with fins and scales, but since catfish lack scales (as do eels and sharks) they were not to be eaten (\\xt Lev 11.9-12\\xt*). Fish were also probably brought from Tyre and Sidon, where they were dried and salted. ... \\p Among early Christians, the fish was a favorite image for Jesus, because the Greek word for fish (\\tl ichthus\\tl*) consists of the first letters of the Greek words that tell who Jesus is: \\fig Ihsous Christos Theou uios Swthr| alt=\"Christian fish image\" src=\"christfish.tif\" size=\"col\" ref=\"1.18\"\\fig* \\esbe \\p \\v 19 He went a little farther on and saw two other brothers, James and John, the sons of Zebedee.

The most common fish in the Lake of Galilee were carp and catfish. The Law of Moses allowed people to eat any fish with fins and scales, but since catfish lack scales (as do eels and sharks) they were not to be eaten (Lev 11.9-12). Fish were also probably brought from Tyre and Sidon, where they were dried and salted. ... Among early Christians, the fish was a favorite image for Jesus, because the Greek word for fish (ichthus) consists of the first letters of the Greek words that tell who Jesus is: Ihsous Christos Theou uios Swthr He went a little farther on and saw two other brothers, James and John, the sons of Zebedee. ...

In Japanese these are called Kanji (literally “Han characters”). There are several thousand of these characters to learn. For new readers or readers new to the Biblical texts it may be very difficult for them to recognize what Chinese or Japanese word corresponds to the Han character(s) they are seeing. Ruby glosses: In order to help these readers, some Bibles are printed with glosses using small phonetic characters (e.g. Japanese uses the hiragana alphabet) placed above the more symbolic Han characters to tell the reader how to pronounce the character. These phonetic characters are generically called “ruby glosses” or “rubies”. In Japanese this technique is called Furigana. Description Ruby gloss.

Syntax USFM: \\rb content|@gloss\\rb* USX: content gloss Ruby gloss characters (default attribute) If the base text being glossed (B) is a phrase of multiple Han characters, then the ruby gloss text (gg) may contain multiple elements, one for glossing each of the base text characters making up the phrase.
