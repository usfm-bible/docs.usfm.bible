All USFM markers begin with a backslash character \\. Paragraph markers, and the opening marker for characters and notes are followed by whitespace. Character markers occur in pairs, marking a span of text within a paragraph. The closing marker character is the same as the opening marker, but ends with an asterisk character *. Example: \\w grace\\w*. Note markers also occur in pairs, marking the start and end of the footnote or cross reference content. Some USFM markers include an optional numeric variable, which is represented in this documentation by a hash character . In USFM the number indicates: * A portion of a complete element, or relative weighting of the \"pieces\" of the elements, such as \\mt1, \\mt2, \\mt3 which are parts of a major title. * The level of the division or section (hierarchy). * The level of indentation relative to other like elements, as in poetry (\\q) or lists (\\li#) or outlines (\\io#). marker = marker1 — The unnumbered version of a marker should only be used when only one level of this marker exists within the text. Numbered markers should always be used when more than one level of the marker exists within the text. A specific numbered marker should not be used to indicate a specific occurrence of the element type (e.g. you should not use \\s3 to represent the the particular section heading occuring before the \"Story of Creation\" in Genesis 1.) Elements which make up footnote or cross reference content are character level markers, which means that they define a start and end marker. Some USFM editors interpret the presence of a new character marker as an implicit closure of any preceding character level marker. The majority of scripture translation projects working with USFM have followed this syntax for footnotes or cross references (not supplying the explicit end marker) since this reduces the amount of markup within the notes text, making it easier to read as a result.

Significant whitespace is a critical part of the USFM document and should always be preserved as is. The space after the end of a paragraph marker, or the end of the opening marker within a character or note marker pair. The newline preceding a new paragraph marker. Insignificant whitespace should be normalized by a USFM processor. Multiple whitespace within the body text of a paragraph. Multiple whitespace preceding a paragraph marker. USFM processors should treat the single CR (U+000D) or LF (U+000A) characters, and the sequence Carriage Return-Line Feed (CRLF), like a single LF character. Applications can save documents using the appropriate line-ending convention. All paragraph markers should be preceded by a single newline. As a recommended best practice for USFM editors, inline markup (character-level markup, footnotes, or cross references) should not be preceded by a newline. It would be acceptable for a whitespace normalization process to replace a newline and any preceding space (multiple spaces) before this inline markup with a single space (#3), but it should not remove all whitespace. In the following example, the footnote \\f ...\\f* at Matthew 6:27: \\v 27 Can any of you live a bit longer \\f + \\fr 6.27: \\fq live a bit longer; \\ft or \\fq grow a bit taller.\\f* by worrying about it? would be normalized as: \\v 27 Can any of you live a bit longer \\f + \\fr 6.27: \\fq live a bit longer; \\ft or \\fq grow a bit taller.\\f* by worrying about it? Multiple whitespace between the end of a paragraph marker and the paragraph text are normalized to a single space (U+0020). Multiple whitespace between words are normalized to a single space (U+0020). Multiple whitespace between text and a character or note marker (f, ex, x, ex; not esb or esbe) are normalized to a single space (U+0020). Due to the extensive common practice in USFM documents of adding new verse text after a newline, multiple whitespace between text and a verse marker should be normalized as a single newline. Multiple whitespace preceding a paragraph marker is normalized to a single newline. Normalized whitespace preceding and following a character or note marker pair is preserved. (USFM validation tools may flag suspicious whitespace.) Normalized whitespace preceding the closing marker of a character or note marker pair is preserved. (USFM validation tools may flag suspicious whitespace.) Significant whitespace should not be added to the text. The normalization rules outlined in 3,5,7 can result in whitespace remaining in the text which may be considered insignificant depending on its context. For example, the space preceding the footnote in: \\v 27 Can any of you live a bit longer \\f + \\fr 6.27: \\fq live a bit longer; could be removed: \\v 27 Can any of you live a bit longer\\f + \\fr 6.27: \\fq live a bit longer; And a space after a cross reference occurring at the start of a verse: v 7 \\x - \\xo 2.7: \\xt 1 Co 15.45.\\x* Then the \\nd Lord\\nd* God took some soil from the ground and formed a man could be removed: v 7 \\x - \\xo 2.7: \\xt 1 Co 15.45.\\x*Then the \\nd Lord\\nd* God took some soil from the ground and formed a man Yet, a normalization process cannot generally remove ALL whitespace preceding and following note marker pairs. In many cases a single whitespace is expected between the texts which precede and follows a note. As suggested and recommended earlier: USFM validation tools may flag suspicious whitespace. USFM editors can takes steps to discourage ambiguous whitespace wherever possible. USFM normalization tools can identify and handles special contexts (examples above). USFM publication tools and other post processors can identify and handle special contexts in the manner which is most suitable for the intended output.","title":"Whitespace","component":"usfm-usx-docs","version":"latest","name":"whitespace","url":"/usfm-usx-docs/latest/whitespace.html","titles":[{"text":"Newlines","hash":"newlines","id":1},{"text":"Whitespace Normalization","hash":"normalization","id":2},{"text":"Handling special contexts","hash":"_handling_special_contexts","id":3}]},"8":{"id":8,"text":"USFM and USX 3 provide a syntax for adding named attributes to character markers. Attributes define additional properties for the marked content, and are a means of extending the meta-information contained within in a text. USFM formally defines attributes for a selected set of current character types. In USFM, within a character marker span an attributes list is separated from the text content by a vertical bar |. Attributes are listed as pairs of name + corresponding value using the syntax: attribute=\"value\". The attribute name is a single ASCII string. The value is wrapped in quotes. In USX, attributes are applied to elements in the standard XML syntax: attribute=\"value\". USFM USX Example 1. Glossary word with lemma attribute \\w gracious|lemma=\"grace\"\\w* Example 2. Glossary word with lemma attribute gracious Nearly all USX elements contain a required style attribute. For and elements, the style attribute defines the paragraph or character type. In USFM, when content is supplied in the position of an attribute, but without an explicit attribute name, the specification defines a single default. This allows a commonly used attribute (the default) to be added with as little additional markup in the text as possible. The concept of a \"default attribute\" is only valid in USFM. In USX, attributes always need to be expressed fully as attribute=\"value\" together. USFM USX Example 3. Glossary word with un-named default lemma attribute \\w gracious|grace\\w* Example 4. USX: Glossary word with lemma attribute gracious In cases where more than one value is needed for an attribute key, use a comma separated list within the value string.

Glossary word with multiple strong values gracious See the attributes for wordlist/glossary entry for other examples. In cases where an attribute value is composed of multiple parts (e.g. a compound word or phrase), separate the parts using a colon : within the value string. See the gloss attribute for ruby glosses for an example of the use of this syntax. Pre-existing markers which formally provide attributes in USFM/USX 3 (or newer) may continue to be used without attributes. \\w gracious\\w* (no attributes) and gracious remain valid. Using the general syntax above, attributes may be added to any character markers beyond the formalized set in the current version of the USFM/USX specification.

Syntax USFM: \\style\\* USX: style * Milestone type qt# - Quotations ts - Translator’s section USFM USX Markup for identifying milestones is needed when documents have multiple structures that interact in a non-hierarchical manner. This is also referred to as 'overlapping' or 'concurrent' markup. A key example of the overlapping structures in scripture text are Paragraphs used to structure the discourse/narrative of the text and The division of the text into books, chapters and verses. In USFM or USX texts, markup identifying paragraph level containers forms the main structure of the document, while chapter and verse markers are effectively milestones. Another overlapping structure is encountered when identifying the start and end of the words of individual speakers within the text, which will regularly cross paragraph boundaries. In USFM, milestones follow a syntax similar to character level markup, but using a unique self-closing syntax. This specific syntax identifies the marker as a milestone. Milestones can mark a single position within the text, or the positions of the start or end of a span of text. Self-closing markup is indicated by immediately terminating the marker, and any attributes, with a second backslash plus asterisk \\*. In USX, a milestone is expressed using the element. A milestone marker may end with either -s or -e -s indicates that the milestone is for marking the start of a span of text. -e indicates that the marker is an end milestone. USFM USX Example 1. USFM: Milestones for the start and end of a quotation/speaker \\qt1-s\\* ... \\qt1-e\\* Example 2. USX: Milestone for the start of a quotation/speaker ... This syntax can also be used for standalone milestones, not using start -s and end -e suffixes. USFM USX Example 3. USFM: Standalone milestone (\\z namespace in this example) \\zms\\* Example 4. USX: Standalone milestone USFM or USX do not currently define any standalone milestones. This may change with future updates, as specific needs are identified. The following optional attributes can be added to any USFM milestone marker. sid A unique identifier which can be used to unambiguously identify the starting milestone, and to clearly associate the starting milestone with the ending milestone (eid). The sid can be composed of any mixture of numbers, letters, and underscores, and should be a unique sid throughout the scripture text. eid A unique identifier which can be used to unambiguously identify the ending milestone, and to clearly associate the ending milestone with the starting milestone (sid). If an sid attribute is used for the starting milestone in a milestone pair, the ending milestone must include eid. Additional attributes may be available for or required by a specific milestone type (e.g the use of the who attribute in the following quotation milestone example). USFM USX Example 5.

In the example above of the quotation/speaker milestone, a numbered version of the marker may be used to indicate the level of nesting of the quotation being marked (i.e. a quote within a quote). The unnumbered version may be used when only one level of marker exists within the project text. Numbers should always be included when more than one level of the marker exists within the project text.","title":"Milestones","component":"usfm-usx-docs","version":"latest","name":"index","url":"/usfm-usx-docs/latest/ms/index.html","titles":[{"text":"Summary","hash":"_summary","id":1},{"text":"Diagrams","hash":"_diagrams","id":2},{"text":"Background","hash":"_background","id":3},{"text":"Basic Syntax","hash":"_basic_syntax","id":4},{"text":"Indicating Start and End Milestones","hash":"_indicating_start_and_end_milestones","id":5},{"text":"Standalone Milestones","hash":"_standalone_milestones","id":6},{"text":"Attributes","hash":"_attributes","id":7},{"text":"Levels","hash":"_levels","id":8}]},"19":{"id":19,"text":"Description Quotation start and end milestones.

In Japanese these are called Kanji (literally “Han characters”). There are several thousand of these characters to learn. For new readers or readers new to the Biblical texts it may be very difficult for them to recognize what Chinese or Japanese word corresponds to the Han character(s) they are seeing. Ruby glosses: In order to help these readers, some Bibles are printed with glosses using small phonetic characters (e.g. Japanese uses the hiragana alphabet) placed above the more symbolic Han characters to tell the reader how to pronounce the character. These phonetic characters are generically called “ruby glosses” or “rubies”. In Japanese this technique is called Furigana. Description Ruby gloss.
